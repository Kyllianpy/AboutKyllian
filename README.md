Hi there! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I'm Kyllian, a Sophomore Computer Science Major at Georgia State University.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and aspiring Software Engineer.

Outside of school, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also read a lot of psychology books, anime manga and make watch tech-related TikToks.
